LabelDebugTool
============
Because the relevant information in PyQt5 web channel is limited on the web, this tool will help future developers debug. This tool is lightweight and independent of py_labeler. If py_labeler doesn't work or gets stuck, it can detect problems in package installations, PyQt5 web channel and HTML.
